\chapter{Conclusion}

The main objective of this work was to implement an efficient algorithm to find
the Rainbow version of Dirac's Theorem based on the work done by \cite{Joos_2020}.
The biggest challenge found in the implementation done in \autoref{chap:algorithmic} was 
finding a $\mathcal{G}$-transversal of length $n$ from a $\mathcal{G}$-transversal of length $n - 1$.

A battery of tests was also made to test our implementation.

We study the Rainbow version of Ore's Theorem, which is a generalization of
the Rainbow version of Dirac's Theorem. Although we do a proof similar
to \cite{Joos_2020} to prove the can find a 
$ \mathcal{G} $-transversal that is a cycle of length $ n - 1 $, it remains
to be seen if there is a proof of existence of a 
$ \mathcal{G} $-transversal that is a Hamiltonian cycle.
