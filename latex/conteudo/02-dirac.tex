\chapter{Dirac's Theorem}

\section{Hamiltonian Cycles}

Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a hamiltonian cycle of $G$ is a cycle that visits every vertex of $G$ exactly once.
Finding whether a graph has a hamiltonian cycle is a well-known NP-complete problem. 
However, there are conditions that guarantee the existence of a hamiltonian cycle in a graph, one of them being Dirac's theorem.
